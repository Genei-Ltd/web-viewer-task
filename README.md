# web-viewer-task

In Genei, users can view web resources submitted through a url via our web viewer. We fetch the html from that url and pass it through an html parser to simplify the content and then convert it to a JSON representation. Within the web viewer, we render this JSON to the DOM. Users can then make highlights over arbitrary ranges of text within the viewer. In this task, weâ€™d like to see your attempt at building a performant web viewer in React. A user should be able to select an arbitrary range of text within the web viewer and make a highlight through a floating toolbar. You may use any libraries you want to help you achieve this. A starter repo for this task is found here.
